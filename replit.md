# Overview

This is a simple Python application that prints greeting messages to the console. The project consists of a single Python script that demonstrates basic print functionality.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Structure

**Single-File Python Script**
- **Problem**: Need to execute basic Python code for demonstration or learning purposes
- **Solution**: A standalone `main.py` file that runs directly without additional dependencies
- **Rationale**: Simplicity and minimal setup - ideal for quick prototyping, testing, or educational purposes

## Runtime Environment

**Python Interpreter**
- **Requirement**: Execute Python code
- **Solution**: Standard Python runtime (version not specified in repository)
- **Pros**: 
  - No compilation required
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Easy to modify and test
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires Python installation on target system

## Design Patterns

**Procedural Programming**
- The code follows a simple procedural approach with sequential execution
- No object-oriented patterns, modules, or functions currently implemented
- Direct execution from top to bottom

# External Dependencies

## Runtime Dependencies
- **Python**: Standard Python interpreter (no specific version constraints detected)

## Third-Party Libraries
- None - the application uses only built-in Python functionality (`print` statements)

## External Services
- None - the application is self-contained with no external API calls, database connections, or service integrations

## Development Tools
- No package manager files (requirements.txt, Pipfile, pyproject.toml) detected
- No testing frameworks configured
- No linting or formatting tools specified
